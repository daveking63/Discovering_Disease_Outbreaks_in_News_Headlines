    "<h4>Some potential problems</h4>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><i>Accent Marks</i> -- A large number of the cities in the world have names with accents (e.g. São Paulo, Brazil). However, in the headlines there are no accent marks (e.g. Zika Infested Monkeys in Sao Paulo). Need to develop a search scheme that ignores the accents.</li>\n",
    "    <li><i>Headlines without Country or State/Province/Region Names</i> -- Most of the headlines have no country names or state/province/region names (e.g. in the above sample there is only one - Recife, Brazil). Since most city names are not unique (e.g. there are at least 6 cities in the world named Los Angeles and there are at least 11 cities in the U.S. named Dallas), we need to have a way to determine which of the possibilities is most probable.</li>\n",
    "    <li><i>Number of City Names that are Common (English) Words</i> -- In the 'geonamecache' dictionaries (discussed below) there are at least: 5 two letter words that are city names including the word 'Of'; 125 names with only three letters including 'Man', 'Gap', and 'Bar'; 720 four letter names including: Best, Date, Much, and Same. This means we have to have a strategy for handling uppercase letters and 'capitalized' words and a strategy for determining whether the word is a location or not. For instance, in the headline above \"Dallas man comes down with case of Zika\" we know that 'man' is not a location, but how do we determine this programmatically.</li>\n",
    "    <li><i>City Names with Two or More Words</i> -- Many city names consist of two or more words. Often, the individual words are also the names of cities. In the above examples, a case in point is Miami Beach. Miami is a legitimate location and so is Miami Beach. Same is true for a city like San Francisco. 'San' is the name of a city and, obviously, so is San Francisco. Again, we need a search strategy that chooses the most likely candidate.</li>\n",
    "    <li><i>Punctuation Marks in Location Names</i> -- Occasionally, location names will contain punctuation marks.  For example, names with apostorphes to designate possession (e.g. Chicago's First Zika Case Confirmed) or names that have been hypenated (e.g.Thailand-Zika Virus in Bangkok). Looking at it, the first instinct is to eliminate the punctuation marks. Problem is that 64 of the city names in the geonamecache city dictionary have one or more apostrophes and 758 have hypenated names.</li> \n",
    "    <li><i>Headlines with Missing or Unmatched Location Names</i> -- Some headlines lack location names altogether (e.g. 'Zika Virus sparks International Concern'). Others, specify a location name but not a specific city or country name (e.g. 'Louisiana Zika cases up to 26' or 'New Zika Case Confirmed in Sarasota County'). While we can jetison the first example, what about the other two? Eventually, we want to associate specific locations with the names, so what method would we use in these sorts of cases?</li>\n",
    "    <li><i>Headlines with no Disease Mentioned</i> -- While the initial focus is on delineating location names, there are sentences that have locations but are missing a well-delineated disease. Cases in point are the following headlines in the above examples: 'Geneve Scientists Battle to Find Cure' and 'The CDC in Atlanta is Growing Worried'. Or, one that is not displayed: 'Cancun hit by Party Fever.' With the first two, the full story might provide the name of the disease. In the third case, there is no underlying disease. The question is: do we eliminate these stories. If so, how do we do it programmatically.</li>\n",
