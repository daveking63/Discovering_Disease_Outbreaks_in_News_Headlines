# Discovering_Disease_in_New_Headlines
LiveProject Assignments for Discovering Disease Outbreaks in News Headlines

A LiveProject from Manning Publishers. The project is broken into five parts.

1. Extracting City and Country Information from News Headlines

2. Finding Geographic Locations of Headlines

3. Clustering Headlines Based on Location

4. Identifying Disease Outbreaks

5. Presenting the Disease Outbreak Data

The skills covered in order are the following: text extraction, data manipulation, clustering, interpreting algorithm outputs, and producing an actionable report. The deliverable from each part is a Jupyter notebook (preferably on GitHub) documenting your workflow and results. The final milestone will be a notebook converted to html or a PDF to share the conclusions with your superiors at the WHO. Each section builds upon the previous and will test your skills in a different area of data science. As you go through the project, keep in mind the overall objective: to identify disease outbreaks around the world. The project is representative of the problems solved by data scientists in industry or academia and utilizes the most popular tools for data science in Python.
